# Java Beginner Projects

This repository contains all the projects I undertook while learning the beginning and core Java concepts.
Projects progress from beginner exercises (variables, input/output) to more complex topics (OOP, arrays, exception handling).

## Projects

- [MadLibs](./C:\Users\arhti\IdeaProjects\JavaBeginnerProjects\src\madlibs) - basic input/output and string manipulation.
- ... More to come!
